# Array-Sorter

Master Files for the `InterfaceLab.java` Java program. This program takes an initialized array of elements, such as `int` or `String` and sorts them into ascending order.

This program was written as part of a Lab exercise for the course _CSCI 114: Programming Fundamentals II_. The purpose of the lab was to teach us how to use Interfaces to allow us to write functions that could accept different types of elements for each function call, thus reducing the number of functions that need to be written.

The output for this program can be seen below:
